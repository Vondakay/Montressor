<h1>My top 5 favorite YouTube Videos 2024</h1>
<h2>This is for no specific genre or purpose just a top 5 list based on what I like</h2>
<li>5. Airship prototype with clouds - Godot engine </li> <a>https://youtu.be/7KGQ9NC4uGk?si=5wsJ-0sHioQM_Qy_</a>
<p>Not only does SoggyClog here make one of the coolest flying game demos ever on Godot then never upload again but, its super inspiring to see whats possible on Godot</p>
<li>4. Porter Robinson WORLDS Twitch Stream 8/13/14 - FULL Stream </li> <a>https://youtu.be/SVzZA9A0FsM?si=WVO2V5x_qAc2KZEc</a>
<p>There was so many moments this year that this video was playing on my second monitor as background noise while every once in a while getting insight on Porter's music making process. 
Even cooler to think about how he had no idea this would change his life forever.

<li>3. Pandora's Box by EmpLemon</li> <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-mjTQ0VBwI</a>
<p>Listened to this video on a few different car rides because its just endless cool facts and stories that somehow all tie into to the idea of opening Pandora's Box but in real life examples.</p>
<li>2. Summoning Salt: The Quest for 1 Million Subscribers</li> <a>https://youtu.be/aO93JUEYVQw?si=6v58cWwQjlJ87XDh</a>
<p>Pretty inspiring to see his journey and how openly critical Summoning Salt is about his own work even though they did incredibly good YouTube wise. Its awesome to hear his story and how he looks at everything</p>
<li>1. Casually Explained: Casual Explainer, but Serious Gamer</li> <a>https://youtu.be/LRpTRvvU6M0?si=LnP2r7IpFGkKCwBw</a>
<p>This video is great because he so *casually explains* how he was one of the top ranked StarCraft players... Just out of nowhere drops this lore about himself and I found myself super engaged
    while watching which is very rare for me.
